    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "TEXT, INTEGER, BLOB, AND REAL.  NO, we cannot; they will be cast to the sqlite3 data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Keys are unique to each row of a given table. \n",
    "Foreign keys are primary in another table, but may not be unique to a given row in the current table. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables are two-dimensional data structures that may have common columns or column references to ther tables within a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data has values defined by columns, and individual instances of this data are stored in rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Default/Inner Join drops rows that do not exist in both tables.\n",
    "Left Join keeps all of the original rows and adds to them from the new table, but drops rows in the new table that did not relate to the original table. \n",
    "Right Join does the opposite, keeping all rows from the new table.\n",
    "Full Join combines all rows from both tables\n",
    "Cross Join combines each row of table 1 with each row of table 2; it's a cartesian join. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions provide a method by which columns of data may be analyzed (including counting, min/max, average, sum) and then aggregated or \"grouped\" into.  An aggregate function requires a group-by statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "An associative entity is a table created in a many-to-many join, where each row of each table can relate to multiple rows of the other table.  The associative entity creates a bridge between the two tables to make the join possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
